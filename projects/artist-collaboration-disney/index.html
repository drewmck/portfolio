<h1>Liveshare : Remote Artist Collaboration</h1>


<p class="bi-line">
The Remote Artist Collaboration project was an effort to enable Disney Animation Studios artists to collaborate with off-site animation talent. Efforts to do so at the time relied heavily on outdated fax and phone to collaborate on creative artifacts. Design goals for this project included a low-cost, minimal setup, plug-and-play system which would be effective in creating a collaborative environment.
</p>


<h2>User Research</h2>
<p>
The explorative research for this project included interviews and contextual inquiry with a test audience of artists. Our team conducted interviews with artists in a variety of roles within DAS, as well as technical support analysts who work with those artists. We conducted observations with artists collaborating in-process throughout the process.
</p>
<p>
Our team also sat in on a number of “Animation Dailies” where directors would review the bi-daily work of an animator. This provided a means for understanding how downward-collaboration was conducted from director-to-artist, a common form of collaboration with remotely-located groups.

<h2>Design Development</h2>
<p>
Design for this began with sketching of possible design concepts. We began with solutions for both the digital review room and individual artist feedback. We later learned that there was a greater need for the individual artist system, and so we went ahead with that for a prototype design. Design iterations for the individual artist feedback system continued for a week, working with the technology management and systems department to find a remote screen prototype that would fit our purposes.

<h2>Prototype Development & Testing</h2>
<p>
We began prototype development in a partnership with the technology management department. Using Cintiq’s and the Teradici remote desktop system, we created a dual-use interface for artists.
</p><p>
To simulate the communication method, we used two macbooks with iChat. Artists would communicate physically and verbally to one another by looking up from their canvas and talking or gesturing.
</p><p>
We tested this device first with two animation interns, and then with two pen-and-paper animators within Disney Animation. They said they liked the simplicity and communicative abilities of the prototype, as well as the speed of feedback. There were a few technical limitations, but they noted this was more than acceptable given the collaborative powers. Future prototypes aimed at eliminating these technical quirks.
