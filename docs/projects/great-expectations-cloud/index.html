<h2>Early Designs</h2>
  - Sprint based around ideas that the founders, GTM, and Product had

<h2>Designs</h2>

  <p>
  Focused on existing user behavior with data troubleshooting. Two focus paths based on typical JTBD
  - Creation
  - IR
  </p>

    Viewing data and creating data tests
    - Typical desire is to create data tests, but not entirely sure where to start
    - Designed through the perspective of someone using the system for the first time
